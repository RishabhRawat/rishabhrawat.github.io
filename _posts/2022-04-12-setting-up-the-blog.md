title: Setting up the blog
---

I think I have tried setting up a couple times earlier in my life, leading to me a new rabbithole each time

![xkcd about automation](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png "Setting up a blog instead of automation").


On the other hand I learnt about - 
 - react
 - angular
 - docker
 - hosting a website on heroku (when it was a thing)

What I did not manage to do - 
 - write a single blog post

So this time, I picked off the simplest way of setting up the blog, thanks to github and static site generators (jekyll with hyde theme)

Took me 6 hours to publish my first blog... Still counts as a win!
